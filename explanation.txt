To create a Python program that manages appointments via the command line using the Google Calendar API, 
you will need to follow several setup steps to get your API credentials, install the necessary libraries, 
and then implement the logic for authentication, checking free/busy slots, and creating events. 

Prerequisites and Setup
1. Enable the Google Calendar API: Go to the Google Cloud Console, create a new project, and enable the Google Calendar API.
2. Create OAuth Credentials:
In the console, go to "APIs & Services" > "Credentials".
Click "Create Credentials" > "OAuth client ID".
Select "Desktop app" as the application type and give it a name.
Click "Create", then download the credentials.json file and place it in the same directory as your Python script.

3. Install Google Client Library:
On Bash:

pip install --upgrade google-api-python-client google-auth-httplib2 google-auth-oauthlib

4. Google Calendar IDs: You will need the email addresses associated with the service provider's and client's Google Calendars. 

Python Program
example.py

How to Run the Program
Save the code above as a Python file (e.g., scheduler.py).
Ensure you have credentials.json in the same directory. The first time you run a command, a browser window will open 
asking for authentication. After granting permission, a token.json file will be created for future use. 

Example Usage (List Slots):
To list available 30-minute slots for the next 24 hours:

bash
# Ensure you use your specific provider email and correct time formats
python scheduler.py --mode list --provider_calendar_id "provider-email@gmail.com" --start_time "2025-06-11T09:00:00Z" --end_time "2025-06-12T09:00:00Z" --duration 30

Example Usage (Book Appointment):
To book an appointment in one of the discovered slots:

bash
# Ensure you use your specific provider email and client email, and a valid start time
python scheduler.py --mode book --provider_calendar_id "provider-email@gmail.com" --client_email "client-email@example.com" --start_time "2025-06-11T10:00:00Z" --duration 30
